# House_price_pridiction_pro
To build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features like area, number of bedrooms, location, etc. The model will help users estimate property prices accurately and efficiently.
Predict the price of a house based on input features.
Ensure the dataset includes features like:
Area (square feet)
Number of bedrooms, bathrooms
Location (encoded as categorical or coordinates)
Year of construction
Amenities (pool, garden, etc.)

Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values using imputation techniques.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize relationships between features and the target variable (e.g., scatter plots, heatmaps).

Creating new features like price per square foot.
Combine related features for better predictions.

Model Building:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80%-20%).
Choose and implement regression algorithms:

Linear Regression
Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Flask/Django (for deployment)
Algorithms: Regression techniques (Linear, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
